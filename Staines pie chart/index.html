</h1>

 <p style="font-family:verdana">We looked at twenty one schools in Staines with the majority of the schools being rated ‘Good’. This rating is average and the standard across the country. They had one school rated ‘Outstanding’. While looking at over twenty schools the average for Surrey is to have more than one school rated “Outstanding’. On the other hand Staines had one school rated ‘Inadequate’ no other region of Surrey that we looked at, had an school rated ‘Inadequate’. Staines also had two schools that ‘Requires Improvement’. This all shows that Staines' education standard is lower than the rest of Surrey. .</p>
